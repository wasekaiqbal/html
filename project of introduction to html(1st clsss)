         Light pollution refers to the excessive or misdirected artificial light that brightens the night sky, diminishing the natural darkness. It is caused by sources such as streetlights, commercial signage, and poorly designed outdoor lighting. Light pollution not only obscures the stars and disrupts astronomical observations but also negatively impacts ecosystems by confusing nocturnal animals and altering their natural behaviors. Additionally, it can affect human health by interfering with sleep patterns and circadian rhythms. Addressing light pollution involves using shielded lighting, reducing unnecessary illumination, and promoting awareness of its environmental and health consequences.<br>
